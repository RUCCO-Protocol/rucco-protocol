# Security Checklist for RUCCO Protocol Implementation

## 🔒 Multisig Security (Critical - July 2025)

### Before Any Multisig Operations:
- [ ] Verify multisig contract is **open-source** and **non-upgradable**
- [ ] Use **hardware wallets** (Keystone, Ledger, Trezor) for all signers
- [ ] Never sign through browser extensions with unknown security
- [ ] Validate transaction details before signing (no blind signing)
- [ ] Use **decentralized frontends** when possible

### Recommended Multisig Providers:
- ✅ **Squads** (manages $170M+, conducting security review)
- ✅ Native SPL Token multisig (basic but secure)
- ❌ Avoid centralized signing interfaces

## 🛡️ Token-2022 Security Considerations

### Extension-Specific Risks:
- **CPI Guard**: Requires delegation flow for transfers
- **Transfer Hooks**: Custom logic = custom risks
- **Confidential Transfers**: Audit key management carefully

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] All Token-2022 extensions are audited (March 2025 ✅)
- [ ] Test on devnet with small amounts first
- [ ] Verify metadata pointer authenticity
- [ ] Check transfer fee calculations

## 🔍 Infrastructure Security

### Environment Hardening:
- [ ] Use offline signing when possible
- [ ] Verify all dependencies and frontends
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious transactions

### Emergency Procedures:
- [ ] Have incident response plan
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication on all accounts
- [ ] Regular security audits of your implementation
