## About

This repository contains technical documentation and research for implementing decentralized coordination patterns using Solana's Token-2022 program extensions.

## 🚨 Security Alert (Updated July 2025)
**BEFORE implementing any patterns from this documentation:**
- ✅ Verify all multisig contracts are open-source and non-upgradable
- ✅ Use hardware wallets for all multisig operations
- ✅ Never sign transactions through compromised frontends
- ✅ Review [recent multisig attacks](https://blockworks.co/news/safe-exploit-comprehensive-review) and mitigations

See [Security Checklist](./docs/SECURITY.md) for complete guidelines.

## Documentation

- **[Technical Whitepaper](./docs/technical-whitepaper.md)** - Protocol specification and implementation patterns
- **[Implementation Notes](./docs/implementation-notes.md)** - Technical considerations and examples
- **[Token-2022 Integration](./docs/token2022-integration.md)** - Solana Token-2022 usage patterns

## Current Status

**✅ Production Ready - Security Critical**
Token-2022 has completed multiple security audits as of March 2025.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Recent multisig infrastructure attacks (Feb 2025) require additional security measures.

## Technical Focus

- Token-2022 Transfer Fee extension usage patterns
- Metadata extension implementation examples  
- Multi-signature treasury coordination patterns
- Decentralized governance integration approaches
